### RISKS
`F.6.3 Marketing Platform: What risk(s) is/are addressed with this meeting?`
- If we don't create a P3 Communications Research Proposal for DEG, then African Alcoholic Beverage Manufacturers will have less influence over the future of their industry and respective country.

### CASE STUDY
`G.5.4 Sales Platform: How will you describe the value proposition of this meeting?`
- Situation: Rwandan Alcoholic Beverage Manufacturers import 100% of their neutral alcohol.
- Complication: Their import dependence limits their control over the future of their industry.
- Resolution: Use oS3 to create an 84-day Go-To-Market Strategy grounded in Rwanda's Vision 2050 that gives Alcoholic Beverage Manufacturers that opportunity to define the future of their Neutral Alcohol Supply and Value Chain.

### MINUTES
`H.4.5 Communications Platform: What notes and action items define this meeting?`
#### Title
Potential Title:
* Using Biomimicry to Transform an Investmement Memo into a Parallel Permaculture Platform to Disrupt Africa's Neutral Alcohol Supply Chain

#### Abstract
* Problem/ Contect:
  * We live in a fractal universe
  * Our institutions are inherently modeled after existing systems in nature
  * Taking the position that humanity's institutions are a larger fractal projection of a human
  * In relationton to the maturity of other systems on The Planet and the universe, our institutions are in their adolescent phase
  * This presents a problem because the small percentage of people in charge of our institutions are more focused on aligning with and maintaining institutional behavior
  * Creating a Parallel Permaculture Platform to create a parallel society by using permaculture design with a healthy eukaryotic cell as the basis of design for how open source platforms are created
  * The reasoning for using a healthy eukaryotic cell as our basis of design is because of its success
  * Eukaryotic cells are elegant and self-soverign but require collective networks in order to create value on a larger scale
  * DEG is presenting a research proposal that will span 4 years and focus on the ability to turn an investment memo workpad into an open source and decentralized platform ecosystem
  * Meeting protocol will serve as the nucleus of the system
  * This will be ongoing applied research with DEG Entreprises performing research from the fields of Biomimicry, Machine Learning, Civil Engineering, and Blockchain technology
  * Aim is to create an 84-day go-to-market strategy grounded in Rwanda's Vision 2050 that gives DEG's target audience, Alcoholic Beverage Manufacturers, the opportunity to create a communications platform based on collective intelligence
#### Background
* Research Background
  * Research is grounded in Platform Design Engineering and Biomimicry
  * Platform Design is based on four main players: Owner, Producer, Provider, and Consumer
  * Research areas will follow these four platform Players
  * OWNER = Biomimicry Inspired Platform Design Engineering to inform African Investors how to assess and invest in African Platforms derived from Malanga Value Added Products fueled by Alternative Asset Management
  * PRODUCER = Machine Learning to empower African Smallholder farmers and renters with Property Management skills
  * PROVIDER = Civil Engineering to empower African Manufacturers with Owner's Representatives skills
  * CONSUMER = Blockchain Technology (specifically proof-of-work inspired by Bitcoin) to empower African Urban Planners with Open Source Governance Skills

    * [What is Web5?](https://developer.tbd.website/blog/what-is-web5/)

#### Questions
* The following are research questions that this paper will explore
  * OWNER: How will biomimicry inspired platform ecosystems influence the future of our global institutions and help Rwanda reach each pillar of its Vision 2050?
  * PRODUCER: How will fractal supply chains supported by machine learning empower African smallholder farmers and renters who are living in poverty?
  * PROVIDER: How will open source civil chains supported by civil engineering and building information modeling digital twins transform African Manufacturing?
  * CONSUMER: How will collaborative value chains supported by blockchain and web5 open up new potential for urban planning and open source governance that helps decentralize institutions?
 
#### Methods
* Research Type
  * Qualitative - tracking sentiment from different participants in the ecosystem based on what they add to the open source communications platform
  * Quantitative - tracking progress towards the different Vision 2050 objectives based on internally set metrics
  * Experimental - creating 28-day and 84-day experiments over the course of the research project to track how investmenet memos are turned into each platform within the P3 Ecosystem
  * Correlational - Parallel structures of each platform will be related to eukaryotic cells, fungi, human physiology, tree anatomy, and global institutions
* Population and Sample
  * Rwanda's Neutral Alcohol Supply and Value Chain will be the sample size
  * Data will be collected on an ongoing basis for the first four years of operation
* Research Methods
  * Experiments
  * beatDrops (28-day go-to-market strategy experiments that invite different individuals to contribute time, resources, and data to the research project)
* Practicalities
  * How much time will you need? 4 years
  * How will you gain access to your population? Participants will opt in by contributing to the platform ecosystem directly as a partner or indirectly as content creators on social media
  * How will you address obstacles you face? The entire process will be open source, so obstacles will be tracked and shared in real time to source potential solutions from the community. Multiple solutions to each obstacle can be created due to the open source nature of the experiment 

#### Significance
* Why is this relevant
  * DEG wants to expand its platform across Africa, so having an in depth research project will provide necessary lessons learned to reduce risk as the platform grows to new countries and different indistries
  * Rwanda Vision 2050 is the main focus for the country, and our research being aligned with its goals mean our open source approaches will directly benefit the country's goals
  * Our efforts with Rwanda Vision 2050 can be adapted to other countries based on their unique long term initiatives
  * Our efforts with Rwanda Vision 2050 can be scaled up to regional and continental initiatives
  * Our open source approach to developing this platform ecosystem will provide critical and innovative capacity building for Africa in biomimicry, platform design engineering, regenrative agriculture, permaculture design, machine learning, civil engineering, and blockchain development
  * Creating a platform ecosystem centered around a self-sovereign manufacturing operation can be a benefit to any country or region on the planet
  * The work we're doing is meant to help Rwanda and The Planet contribute to helping humanity become a Type I, II, and III civilization in the long term based on the Kardeshev Scale

#### Budget
* What is the budget for this project?
  * $144,000/year over four years
  * The budget funds the daily management, design, engineering, and building required for the P3 Ecosystem
